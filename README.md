# 🔐 Password Strength Checker

A simple Python-based project that evaluates password strength using regular expressions (regex). This project reflects my interest in cybersecurity and helped me strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals and regex-based pattern matching.

## 🚀 Features
- Classifies passwords as Weak, Medium, or Strong
- Uses regex to check for length, digits, uppercase, lowercase, and symbols
- Beginner-friendly and lightweight project

## 📖 How It Works
1. The user enters a password.
2.  The script checks for:
  - Minimum length (8 characters)
  - At least one digit
  - At least one uppercase & lowercase letter
  - At least one special symbol
3. Based on these checks, it rates the password’s strength.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Regex (re module)

## 📂 Usage

## Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-strength-checker.git  

## Run the script
python3 app.py


## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add GUI (Tkinter/Flask web app)
- Suggest stronger alternatives for weak passwords
- Extend regex for wider symbol support

## ✨ Learning Outcome
- Deeper understanding of Python scripting
- Practical use of regex
- Introduction to cybersecurity practices like password safety
